# Between-Two-Sets-ALGO

/This program finds the number of integers that are multiples of all elements in array `a` and divisors of all elements in array `b`. It calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `b`, then counts the multiples of the LCM that evenly divide the GCD.
